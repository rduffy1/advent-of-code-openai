how do I get rid of empty strings in arrays?

To remove empty strings from an array, you can use the filter() method. This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function should check if the element is an empty string and return false if it is, which will cause it to be removed from the new array.

Here's an example of how you could use the filter() method to remove empty strings from an array:

Copy code
const array = ['foo', '', 'bar', '', 'baz'];

// Create a new array with only the non-empty strings from the original array
const nonEmptyStrings = array.filter(string => string !== '');

console.log(nonEmptyStrings);  // Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
Another option is to use the Array.prototype.indexOf() method to find the indices of the empty strings in the array, and then use the Array.prototype.splice() method to remove them. Here's an example of how you could do that:

Copy code
const array = ['foo', '', 'bar', '', 'baz'];

// Find the indices of the empty strings in the array
const emptyStringIndices = [];
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  if (array[i] === '') {
    emptyStringIndices.push(i);
  }
}

// Remove the empty strings from the array using the indices we found
for (let i = 0; i < emptyStringIndices.length; i++) {
  array.splice(emptyStringIndices[i], 1);
}

console.log(array);  // Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
Both of these methods will remove empty strings from the array, but the filter() method is generally considered to be more concise and readable.

In python please

To remove empty strings from a list in Python, you can use a list comprehension with the not keyword. This will create a new list that only includes the non-empty strings from the original list.

Here's an example of how you could use a list comprehension to remove empty strings from a list:

Copy code
# Original list
array = ['foo', '', 'bar', '', 'baz']

# Create a new list with only the non-empty strings from the original list
non_empty_strings = [string for string in array if not string == '']

print(non_empty_strings)  # Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
Another option is to use the filter() method, which works similarly to the filter() method in JavaScript. This method creates a new iterator object that only includes the elements from the original list that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function should check if the element is an empty string and return False if it is, which will cause it to be removed from the new list.

Here's an example of how you could use the filter() method to remove empty strings from a list in Python:

Copy code
# Original list
array = ['foo', '', 'bar', '', 'baz']

# Create a new list with only the non-empty strings from the original list
non_empty_strings = list(filter(lambda string: not string == '', array))

print(non_empty_strings)  # Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
Both of these methods will remove empty strings from the list, but the list comprehension is generally considered to be more concise and readable.
